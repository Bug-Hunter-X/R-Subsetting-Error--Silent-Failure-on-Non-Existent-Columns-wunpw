```R
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector that contains non-existent column names.

df <- data.frame(A = 1:3, B = 4:6, C = 7:9)
columns_to_select <- c("A", "D", "E")
subset_df <- df[, columns_to_select]

# The error occurs because "D" and "E" do not exist as columns in the df.
# This leads to an error that might be difficult to debug because it doesn't give a clear explanation of why it went wrong.
