# R Subsetting Error: Silent Failure on Non-Existent Columns

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors containing non-existent column names.  The code silently fails, returning only a subset of the data without warnings or errors, masking the underlying issue. This can be difficult to detect and lead to inaccurate results.

## The Problem
When you try to select columns from a data frame that don't exist, you would expect an error or warning.  In R, this doesn't occur if the vector also contains some valid column names. The code will proceed but the missing columns will just be dropped, which can cause very confusing behavior. 

## The Solution
The solution is to explicitly check whether all specified columns exist before performing the subsetting operation. This can prevent silent failures and make your code more robust.
